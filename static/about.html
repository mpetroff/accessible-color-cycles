Something goes here...
</p>


<h3 class="title is-4">Cookies</h3>

<p class="content">
A first party cookie is used but only for the data collection endpoint. It
stores encrypted session information to allow for a stateless server
implementation while preventing tampering, e.g. allowing someone to submit
their preferred color cycle many times in an attempt to skew the results. The
cookie is deleted when the user's browser is closed (at least for most
browsers).
</p>


<h3 class="title is-4">Data collected</h3>

<p class="content">
The types of data collected are listed below, as are how they will be used.
While an effort was made to ensure that this list is accurate, minor deviations
may happen, should the need arise.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-5">Questionnaire responses</h4>

<h5 class="title is-6">Colorblindness information</h5>

<p class="content">
Colorblindness information is collected to explore how color vision
deficiencies affect how one rates color cycles. This session data will be
publicly released. However, if any given category has fewer than 100 associated
sessions, it will be classified as &ldquo;other&rdquo; in the released data.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-5">Survey responses</h4>

<p class="content">
Survey response data will be publicly released and linked to the corresponding
user session. For each response, this data includes the two color sets
presented; the rendering mode used to present then, i.e. whether a line chart
of scatter plot was displayed; the color set picked; the four color cycles
presented; the color cycle picked; and the number of color cycle responses so
far in the session.
</p>


<h4 class="title is-5">Browser / network information</h4>

<h5 class="title is-6">IP address</h5>

<p class="content">
The user&rsquo;s anonymized IP address is recorded for each request primarily
to help filter out responses submitted by bad actors. It may also be used to
derive a country code for each session. To anonymize the IP address, the last
byte zeroed in the case of IPv4, and the last four bytes zeroed in the case of
IPv6. The full IP address is not written to disk.
</p>
<p class="content">
No IP addresses will be publicly released. Derived country codes may be
publicly released, linked to individual sessions. However, if any given country
code has fewer than 100 associated sessions, it will be classified as
&ldquo;other&rdquo; in the released data.
</p>


<h5 class="title is-6">User agent</h5>

<p class="content">
The user agent provided by the user&rsquo;s browser will be recorded for each
session. This will be used to help filter out responses submitted by bad actors
and to potentially help diagnose issues with certain browsers (and to filter
out the data if need be).
</p>
<p class="content">
Browser type information for major browsers, e.g. Firefox or Chrome, associated
with a session will be publicly released. Unusual browsers will be classified
as &ldquo;other&rdquo; in the released data. Raw user agent information will
not be publicly released.
</p>


<h5 class="title is-6">Window size</h5>

<p class="content">
The browser window size rounded to the nearest 100&thinsp;px will be recorded
at the start of each session, as will the window orientation, i.e. whether it
is landscape orientation or portrait orientation. This information is recorded
as it may prove useful during analysis of the survey results.
</p>
<p class="content">
Window size information will be used to categorize each session into a screen
size category. These screen size classifications will be publicly released.
