<h1 class="title">Color Cycle Survey</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">About &amp; Privacy</h2>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
A color cycle is an ordered set of colors used for plotting categorical data
for visualization. Unfortunately, most existing color cycles are not
colorblind-friendly. This is an issue since a significant fraction of those
viewing a particular plot may be colorblind, especially in fields with
diversity shortcomings. This survey was conceived out of frustration with this
status quo, in particular with the <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9460">default color cycle</a> of the Matplotlib
plotting library widely use in physics. The technical aspect of this can be
resolved by enforcing minimum perceptual distances between colors, both for
normal color vision and for various types of simulated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness">color vision deficiencies</a>,
a technique that was also used by
<a href="https://mpetroff.net/2018/03/color-cycle-picker/">an earlier effort</a>
that created a colorblind-friendly
<a href="https://colorcyclepicker.mpetroff.net/">color cycle picker</a>.
</p><p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
The above mentioned technique was used to randomly generate 10&thinsp;000 color
sets each of six, eight, and ten color sets, which have minimum perceptual and
lightness distances enforced (see <a href="https://mpetroff.net/2018/10/randomly-generating-color-sets-with-a-minimum-perceptual-distance/">this blog post</a> for details);
full deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia simulations were used.
However, this leaves the aesthetic aspect, which is where this survey comes in.
The goal of this survey is to crowd-source the information needed to generate
aesthetically pleasing color cycles that are also colorblind-friendly. Randomly
generated color sets and cycles, which have a minimum perceptual distance
enforced between colors, are presented for the user to choose the most pleasing
one. These data will then be used to train a model to generate aesthetically
pleasing color cycles. Additionally, once anonymized, the collected data will
be released under a permissive license.

<h3 class="title is-4">Cookies</h3>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
A first party cookie is used but only for the data collection endpoint. It
stores encrypted session information to allow for a stateless server
implementation while preventing tampering, e.g., preventing someone from submitting
their preferred color cycle many times in an attempt to skew the results. The
cookie is deleted when the user&rsquo;s browser is closed (at least for most
browsers).
</p>


<h3 class="title is-4">Server logs</h3>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
Web server logs will be kept for security and traffic analysis purposes. These
logs are recorded separately from the survey data. They may contains
timestamps, IP addresses, and various request header information. They will not
be publicly released.
</p>


<h3 class="title is-4">Data collected with survey</h3>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
The types of data collected are listed below, as are how they will be used.
While an effort was made to ensure that this list is accurate, minor deviations
may happen, should the need arise.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-5">Questionnaire responses</h4>

<h5 class="title is-6">Colorblindness information</h5>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
Colorblindness information is collected to explore how color vision
deficiencies affect how one rates color cycles. These session data will be
publicly released. However, if any given category has fewer than 100 associated
sessions, it will be classified as &ldquo;other&rdquo; in the released data.
</p>

<h4 class="title is-5">Survey responses</h4>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
Survey response data will be publicly released and linked to the corresponding
user session. For each response, these data include the two color sets
presented; the rendering mode used to present then, i.e., whether a line chart
of scatter plot was displayed; the color set picked; the four color cycles
presented; the color cycle picked; and the number of color cycle responses so
far in the session. A timestamp will also be recorded with each response, but
these timestamps will not be publicly released.
</p>


<h4 class="title is-5">Browser / network information</h4>

<h5 class="title is-6">IP address</h5>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
The user&rsquo;s anonymized IP address is recorded for each request primarily
to help filter out responses submitted by bad actors. It may also be used to
derive a country code for each session. To anonymize the IP address, the last
byte is zeroed in the case of IPv4, and the last four bytes are zeroed in the
case of IPv6. The full IP address is not written to disk with survey data.
</p><p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
No IP addresses will be publicly released. Derived country codes or other
derived location information may be publicly released, linked to individual
sessions. However, if any given country code or location has fewer than 100
associated sessions, it will be classified as &ldquo;other&rdquo; in the
released data.
</p>


<h5 class="title is-6">User agent</h5>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
The user agent provided by the user&rsquo;s browser will be recorded for each
session. This will be used to help filter out responses submitted by bad actors
and to potentially help diagnose issues with certain browsers (and to filter
out the data if need be).
</p><p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
Browser type information for major browsers, e.g., Firefox or Chrome, associated
with a session will be publicly released. Unusual browsers will be classified
as &ldquo;other&rdquo; in the released data. Raw user agent information will
not be publicly released.
</p>


<h5 class="title is-6">Window size</h5>

<p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
The browser window size rounded to the nearest 100&thinsp;px will be recorded
at the start of each session, as will the window orientation, i.e., whether it
is landscape orientation or portrait orientation. This information is recorded
as it may prove useful during analysis of the survey results.
</p><p class="content has-text-justified has-text-left-mobile">
Window size information will be used to categorize each session into a screen
size category. These screen size classifications will be publicly released.
